     * @param reinforcing {@code true} if the predicate is at least as
     *            intolerant as the replaced predicate of the same key
     *            (i.e. the predicate doesn't accept any value that was
     *            not accepted by the replaced predicate), {@code false}

     *            avoid applying the predicate on values that we already
     *            know will not be accepted. If this filter is not
     *            replacing an existing one, the value of the
     *            {@code reinforcing} argument has no impact.
